# This is my first post using git-diary!

The git-diary project aims to provide an absolutely basic diary/blogging experience backed by a git repository. The chosen repository must contain a folder named `posts`, and that's it. The details of setting up the repository are explained in the [git-diary-api](https://github.com/pboueke/git-diary-api) project, which is responsible for managing the repository.

Blog posts are written in markdown and saved as plain text in files named as `yyyy-MM-dd-Post-Title.md`. 

This is a very simple project aiming to provide basic file management over a git repository. The API provides an easy way to integrate this solution in file editors, chat bots and whatever else.
